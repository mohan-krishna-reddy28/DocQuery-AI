REQUEST FLOW (VERY IMPORTANT)
   Upload flow
      Client → /upload
         → Read file
         → Chunk text
         → Create embeddings
         → Store in Vector DB
         → Response: "Uploaded successfully"

   Chat flow (RAG)
      Client → /chat (question)
         → Convert question to embedding
         → Search Vector DB
         → Get top-k chunks
         → Inject into prompt
         → Send to LLM
         → Return answer



🧠 Interview-ready understanding (this is GOLD)

If an interviewer asks:

“What is an LLM and how is it used in your RAG project?”

Your answer should be:

“An LLM is a transformer-based model trained on large text data to generate human-like responses.
In my RAG chatbot, the LLM does not answer from memory.
First, relevant content is retrieved from a vector database using embeddings, and then the LLM generates an answer strictly based on that retrieved context, which helps reduce hallucinations.”
